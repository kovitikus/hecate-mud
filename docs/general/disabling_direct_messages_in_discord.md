#### Why would you want to disable direct messages?

On Discord, privacy is important. There are many folk out there who might attempt to attack you personally. But there are also bots that show up in various servers and attempt to scam you with some story of a giveaway and a link to a sketchy site.

**DO NOT EVER CLICK AN UNKNOWN LINK FROM AN UNKNOWN INDIVIDUAL, EVER!**

By default, Discord allows all DMs. You must opt-out of DMs by manually changing the setting.

If you choose to opt-out of DMs it will only affect receiving DMs from strangers. You can still get DMs from friends. Interestingly enough, you will NOT be able to send DMs to strangers either.

#### Disable Direct Messages Per Server
To opt out of DMs in just one specific server, right-click on the server icon on the left side of the screen and select `Privacy Settings` in the drop down menu.

Click the toggle button to turn off DMs on that server.

#### Disable Direct Messages Globally
This is the option that I highly recommend. It stops bots and trolls in their tracks. You can fine-tune your experience by toggling on DMs for trusted servers, especially those that are small communities.

First, click on the `User Settings` cogwheel on the bottom left of your Discord, to the right of your username.

In the `User Settings` menu, click on the `Privacy & Safety` section on the left side of the application.

The second option displayed is `Server Privacy Defaults`. If your toggle button is green with a check mark, this means you are getting all DMs from all servers. Click on the toggle to turn it grey with an X mark to signify that global DMs are now turned off.

When you click this, you will get a pop-up option asking if you'd like to apply this setting to all currently existing servers. My suggestion is that you click yes in order to save yourself from manually turning off DMs per server.

You can now navigate to a specific server and turn DMs back on again, just for that server, if you wish.
